# No-fuss ternary plots in Python

**What is a ternary plot?**  
A [ternary plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_plot) is a triangular diagram that displays the proportion of three variables that sum to a constant, usually 1 or 100%. It is a very common diagram in solid-earth sciences but also used in other physical sciences.

**What is the purpose of this repository?**  
You want to use ternary diagrams in your Jupyter notebook (or script) using Python. Sadly you realise that matplolib does not have ternary diagrams in its default plots. After some research on the internet, you have seen that the alternatives are to install other plotting libraries (e.g. [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/ternary-plots/)) or third-party libraries that depend on matplolib (e.g. [python-ternary](https://github.com/marcharper/python-ternary)). Unfortunately, you don't feel like learning a new syntax for plotting (you are too comfortable with your matplolib buddy) or want to install a new library with all that this entails (dependencies, etc.) that otherwise seem too overkill for your purposes. This is where the good news comes in. Matplotlib allows you to create a simple ternary diagram in very few lines of code, where simple means that it has the minimum necessary elements to correctly interpret a ternary diagram. This is **no new installations, no new dependencies, your usual matplolib syntax, no fuss**.

**How to use it?**  
Simply copy and paste the functions into the cells of your Jupyter notebook and follow the usage examples. Alternatively, you can download the python file containing the functions and save it to the same folder where your notebook is located. Then simply run the script using ``%run ternary.py`` or import it as a module.



**Examples available soon!**
